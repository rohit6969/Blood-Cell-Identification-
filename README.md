# Blood-Cell-Identification-
White Blood cell identification using CNN. 

Neutrophils
Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell (WBC or granulocyte) that protect us from infections, among other functions. They make up approximately 40 percent to 60 percent of the white blood cells in our bodies,1ï»¿ and are the first cells to arrive on the scene when we experience a bacterial infection.

Lymphocyte
Lymphocytes are white blood cells that are also one of the body's main types of immune cells. They are made in the bone marrow and found in the blood and lymph tissue. The immune system is a complex network of cells known as immune cells that include lymphocytes.

Eosinophils
Eosinophils are a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. This condition most often indicates a parasitic infection, an allergic reaction or cancer. You can have high levels of eosinophils in your blood (blood eosinophilia) or in tissues at the site of an infection or inflammation (tissue eosinophilia).

Monocyte
Monocytes are a type of leukocyte, or white blood cell. They are the largest type of leukocyte and can differentiate into macrophages and myeloid lineage dendritic cells. As a part of the vertebrate innate immune system monocytes also influence the process of adaptive immunity.
